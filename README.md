In UWU the freedom is important for every CST student. So there are a lot of barriers in university life. As a result, we developed a game including some barriers to show how to manage his or her freedom. (Hint, Freedom=the boy earned money of the game).

This game is perfectly running.I will check the Ui UX.

Used technologies :
Unity2d
